## My Mission

I was sent here on an *earthly* investigation by the secret alien association. They are considered to be the most **FEARED** vicious reptilian panda breed in Outer space. They, my boss, gave me a human costume -disgusting- to disguise myself among these dorito-eating-flesh-bags. Even though itâ€™s really stuffy in my human skin, the disguise is really working. As always, I successfully found the reason as to why the u.s.a. is suffering from debt and crazy people. Either college, jobs, or **life**. They slowly die due to stress, anxiety and amoungst other things like jumping off an airplane or a cannonball from a mountain to a lake or body of water.
  There's still more to be discovered. *Bye!*
