## My Fabulous Mission

I was sent here on an *earthly* investigation by the secret alien association 935. They are considered to be the most **FEARED** vicious reptilian panda breed in Outer space. They, my boss, gave me a human costume -disgusting- to disguise myself among these bags of rotten flesh. Even though it’s really stuffy in my assigned donated human skin, the disguise is really working. As always, I successfully found the secret of the reason as to why these “students” have a miserable life. These high school students have free education and they graduate with their **ASSOCIATE’S** degree. I wonder as to why would these young humans choose a miserable life running away in the away from debts *inviting* arms?
